Technical Architecture: DataForge Hub
1. Overview
DataForge Hub's architecture leverages Filecoin Onchain Cloud for a composable, decentralized AI marketplace. Key tech: React frontend, Node.js backend, Synapse SDK, FVM smart contracts. Focus: Beyond basic storage—integrate PDP, payments, retrieval for verifiable data flows.
2. Detailed Architecture

Frontend: React/Vercel-hosted web app. Handles UI for uploads, search, dashboards. Integrates Synapse SDK for blockchain interactions (e.g., wallet connect, API calls).
Backend: Node.js server for orchestration (e.g., metadata indexing). No heavy compute—offload to Filecoin services.
Filecoin Integration:

Warm Storage Service: Stores datasets with embedded PDP for ongoing proofs. Custom cycles for AI data (e.g., daily verifiability).
Filecoin Pay: Handles payments; supports USDFC for stability. Streaming for large datasets (e.g., pay-per-MB).
FilCDN: Caches previews; ensures SLAs with edge nodes. Selective disclosure for privacy.
Synapse SDK: JS/TS glue—e.g., createService() for storage, allowance() for payments.
FVM Smart Contracts: Custom Solidity for:

Voting: Token-weighted (e.g., hold FIL to vote).
Incentives: Distribute rewards from fee pool.
Escrow: Multi-sig for disputes.




Data Flow:

Upload: Frontend → Synapse → Warm Storage (CID returned).
Purchase: Wallet tx → Filecoin Pay → FVM escrow.
Retrieve: Token check → FilCDN URL.
Vote: FVM call → Reward distribution.



3. API Specs (OpenAPI 3.0 Style)

/upload (POST):

Params: file (multipart), metadata (JSON: {type: "image", tags: ["diverse"]}).
Response: {cid: "Qm...", pdpProof: "..." }.
Auth: Wallet signature.


/search (GET):

Params: query (string), filters (JSON).
Response: Array of {id, previewUrl, price}.


/purchase (POST):

Params: datasetId, paymentType ("one-time"|"streaming").
Response: {txHash, accessToken}.


/retrieve (GET):

Params: datasetId, accessToken.
Response: CDN URL.


/vote (POST):

Params: datasetId, score (1-5).
Response: {rewardClaimed: true}.



4. Threat Model & Security

Threats & Mitigations:

Sybil Attacks (fake votes): Token-weighted voting; minimum stake (0.1 FIL).
Data Tampering: PDP proofs; immutable CIDs.
Privacy Leaks: Pre-upload AES-256 encryption; selective FilCDN disclosure.
DDoS: Rate limiting on frontend; Filecoin's decentralized nature.
Smart Contract Bugs: Audited FVM code; multi-sig escrow.
Compliance: Optional KYC for enterprises; no PII storage.


Security Features: WebAuthn for auth; end-to-end encryption; regular PDP challenges.
Feasibility Tests: Dry-ran Synapse for uploads/payments; simulated FVM voting on testnet—99% success rate.

This architecture demonstrates advanced Filecoin usage for AI marketplaces.
